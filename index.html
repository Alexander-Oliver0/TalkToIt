            <h2 class="title">Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Our story is about my grandmother. My grandmother is a pretty old lady she reached the age of 95. She really was one of the best cooks I known to this day. She always wanted to make us happy by making the most tasty food and the sweetest desserts. Cooking was her passion. I always knew my grandmother as somebody who wears glasses because she didn’t have the best eyesight. Towards the last years of her life she lost her eyesight completely and she wasn’t the person I used to know. The happy grandmother who always wanted to prepare food for her grandchildren could not do this anymore. This really affected her wellbeing because she felt useless. She could barely do anything by herself anymore. I always tried to help her as much as I could but this was not always possible because I wasn’t at her house every single day. I wanted to give something back for all the joy she brought upon us by treating us. So I started thinking how I could improve her lifestyle. After a lot of research and development I designed a machine that could help so many people around the world and I would like to share it with you.

            <p>
                The product consists of a plastic box that has built in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The setup is really easy. You just have to plug the transmitter into the power socket and then plug the device into the transmitter. You will then be able to connect to the device by using the TalkToIt application. Once this is done you can activate your Siri or Google speech and tell the machine what to do. You can only give it instructions that it actually can do. Your microwave will not be able to make a coffee. The price for 1 transmitter will be settled at €49,99. The application is free for download in the <a href="https://www.apple.com/app-store/">app store</a> and in the <a href="https://play.google.com/">play store</a>.

            <h3>Blind or visually impaired?</h3>
            <p>
                For the people who are blind or visually impaired you can get 1 free sample. The process is very easy. You have to be able to prove to us that you are actually blind or visually impaired. We will need a certified paper from your doctor or hospital confirming that you are blind or visually impaired. This will take 2-4 business days to process. Once all is in order you will receive a confirmation email asking for your residential details.
